<b>Java 8 Predicate:</b><br/><br/>
A functional interface and a way for passing behavior to function on runtime
<br/><br/>
Each implementation need to oveeride the test method which will be evaluation during method call.
<br/><br/>
It helps you to maintain strategy design pattern with open/close principle.
<br/><br/>
Strategy pattern is a  behavioural pattern which give the flexibility to decide the method algorithm during runtime.
